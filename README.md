# LRU-cache

In this project , I have simulated the working of an LRU cache where each set has high and low priority blocks . The cahe is block addressible .

The input file is set as:

Cache size(in bytes)
Block size(in bytes)
Cache associativity
T // the value T denotes the number of cycles till which a block remains in the high priority group without being accessed again
Followed by instructions : two specific instructions Read and Writes are supported
